## Installation

The MIP model for generating MARGOT Trees is implemented in [Gurobi Optimizer](https://www.gurobi.com/solutions/gurobi-optimizer/).

## Requirements

The file requirements.txt reports the list of packages that must be installed to run the code. You can add a package to your environment via pip or anaconda using either pip install "package" or conda install "package".

## Configuration and running

You just need to run `main.py`. 
The parameters are set according to the experiments in the paper, but you can simply modify them via `main.py`. 

## Results

The output of the experiments can be found in folder **results_margot/**, where:

- folder **plots/** will contain all the tree plots files related to the experiments performed.
- file **stats_margot.xlsx** will contain the statistics of all the experiments performed.
